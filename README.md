## Introduction 

Construction Safety Information Blog (CSI) is a blog that focuses on different areas of the contruction industry.  Its aim is to provide informative content for the construction sector so that it can build a community who can share knowledge, ideas and experiences which will be separated into different categories.  These categoreis will be Health and Safety, Quality, Legislation, Projects and Holidays.   The main objective is to share information between different users and delveop robost platform for sharing of related content.

## 1. User Experience 
 
 ### Strategy Project Goals

The blog aims to provide users with inforamtion in certain categories in realtion to the Construction Industry.  
The blog will be a very simple design design so that it doesnt draw attention from the content on the blog.
Structure of the blog to be easily understood.  
Site navigation to be simple and easy to use so that a user can easily find their way around the site.
Site user to be able to register for an account so that they can log in and  interact with the content in the blog.

### Strategy User Goals

As an admin user they will be able to manage the blog posts and comments on the blog. 
As a site user i want to be able to manage the content that i create
It will allow logged in user to input a post, change and update their own posts
and also view other user posts and to like same.  A logged in user will not be able to change another users post so there will be restrictions on some views.  It will also allow logged in users to leave comments, update and delete their comments and view other users comments.  Again there will be a restriction on views here where a user will not be able to update other user comments.  

## User Stories

 Epics
  This blog project has 5 epics or milestones which are as follows: Create Workspace For Project, User Authentication, User Login, CRUD Functionality and General Functionality. 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221386870-65c76070-7ee1-47c9-adf8-568bf9234ecb.png)


Each of the above Epics have their own user stories with acceptance criteria.

There are a total of 12 user stories (note these are numbered 1 to 13)

In relation to the epic for "create workspace for project we have two user stories"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221416070-f6ec4570-20c0-46f4-a632-b27d2e6fe4ef.png)

Epic for "User Authentication" has 2 user stories

Epic General Functionality Has Two User Stories

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221417143-dc1cca77-7dd8-4a90-8eba-83f36e4177bf.png)

Each of the above user stories have been labelled as a must have in order to have a fully functional project.  
Each user story has been labelled to indicate that it is a must have for the project. 

In order to implement the user stories it is hoped that it will be completed in 4 iteratioins assing 1 week to each iteration.

  Week 1 - Iteration 1

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221387626-08b60603-58ff-4df6-ad7e-f676d852915d.png)

   Week 2 - Iteration 2

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221387708-822299fe-6ec4-4be1-80dc-9bd70fd84129.png)

  Week 3 - Iteration 3 

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221387791-b6c99f7e-b61a-49d6-96c9-1b3cbc511aed.png)

  Week 4 - Iteration 4

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221387850-b61082c6-aefa-414f-9314-b44463531ee5.png)

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221387866-46f4dd04-eefc-47f8-920d-897700133b9e.png)

  The above iterations are only an approximate.  As i am a student and very new to coding languages i found that when completing this project I would move onto other user stories without finishing the previous user story as i was conscious of time constraints and also trying research better ways and shorter code in getting functionality working.

  Epics / User Stories / Acceptance Criteria
  Github projects was used in the planning and setting up of this blog project. Here you will see a list of all epics, the user stories connected to these epics and  
  the acceptance criteria for each user story.  Each user story is catgorised into must haves, should have, could have. The Kanban board was used to draw up the individual tasks into different columns namely to do, in progress, done and and will not have..  As each task was worked on it moved from the to do column to the in progress column
    to the final column of done. 
      
  ## 6. Structure - Database

  Structure of Blog Site 
  diagram of pages and blog site

  Header, footer and navigation bar consistent through all pages.
  links, buttons and forms provide feedback to the user of the site. 
  When a user signs up to the blog they have the opportunity to interact with the content by adding, deleting, updating their own posts and comments and  viewing, liking other posts and comments 

  Database Model 
  The database model is displayed on drawsql.  The type of database being used for this project is relational database which is managaed by PostgreSQL.

Wireframe were produced using Balsamiq for Desktop and Mobile. - https://balsamiq.com/
Just to note In all my wireframes for desktop i use a background image of a crane and a orange opaque overlay over the image. I havent included the image in my wireframes as unable to get overlay effect.   

The following are the desktop wireframes.

## 8. Surface - Color Scheme
#
In designment this website i chose the following colors as i felt that they would compliment each other and would be very inviting to the visitor and provide a positive expeirence. 

Teal Color was used for the navbar , heading backgrounds, card background color, footer and text color on some buttons and others it was used as a background color for buttons. It was also used in the logo as it was applied to the text in designing same.   The rgb color used was "rgb(1,116, 129)".

Orange was also used which complimented the Teal.  It was used as the overlay color on the main image for the background on each page.  It was also used to distinguish links such as read more on the cards and for the thumbs up fontawesome icon and counter for the likes functionality. It was also introduced into the logo for the image.  The rgb color used was "rgb(237,177,79)",

White was used for menu links in the nav bar, footer text, fontawesome icons, button text and background color of some buttons. 

Black has been used for all headings in each page and text contained within the cards.  Buttons also contain black text.  

The following site was used to convert my rgb colors into hex colors - https://www.color-hex.com - in order to generate a color chart in coolors.co.  

The color card was drawn up on https://coolors.co/ a copy of the card is below. 

https://coolors.co/000000-ffffff-edb14f-017481

## 9. Surface - Typography
#

In researching fonts i used the google fonts website - https://fonts.google.com/ - and the font that was selected for this project was mainly sans-serif. It is clear and simplistic font making the content very easy to ready.  
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif 

 ![image](https://github.com/NBJIN/constructionblog/assets/106515976/2fd0f126-f294-4a90-a05a-dffd2d77c7a1)



 I wanted to display a welcome message to the logged in user basically advising the user they were logged in and to make this stand out a little i decided to use a font called  Dancing Script https://fontswan.com/dancing-script-font/ which is a font which would stand out and draw attention to it.  I put it in the orange color so that it would compliment with the background of the nav bar and also distinguish itself from the navigational links.  Again google fonts was used in researching same and links to these fonts have been placed in the head section of the base.html file.  

 Exmaple of the Dancing Script font
