## Introduction 

Construction Safety Information Blog (CSI) is a blog that focuses on different areas of the contruction industry.  Its aim is to provide informative content for the construction sector so that it can build a community who can share knowledge, ideas and experiences which will be separated into different categories.  These categoreis will be Health and Safety, Quality, Legislation, Projects and Holidays.   The main objective is to share information between different users and delveop robost platform for sharing of related content.

 ## User Experience 
 
 ### Strategy Project Goals

The blog aims to provide users with inforamtion in certain categories in realtion to the Construction Industry.  
The blog will be a very simple design design so that it doesnt draw attention from the content on the blog.
Structure of the blog to be easily understood.  
Site navigation to be simple and easy to use so that a user can easily find their way around the site.
Site user to be able to register for an account so that they can log in and  interact with the content in the blog.

### Strategy User Goals

As an admin user they will be able to manage the blog posts and comments on the blog. 
As a site user i want to be able to manage the content that i create
It will allow logged in user to input a post, change and update their own posts
and also view other user posts and to like same.  A logged in user will not be able to change another users post so there will be restrictions on some views.  It will also allow logged in users to leave comments, update and delete their comments and view other users comments.  Again there will be a restriction on views here where a user will not be able to update other user comments.  

## User Stories

 Epics
  This blog project has 5 epics or milestones which are as follows: Create Workspace For Project, User Authentication, User Login, CRUD Functionality and General Functionality. 
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221386870-65c76070-7ee1-47c9-adf8-568bf9234ecb.png)


Each of the above Epics have their own user stories with acceptance criteria.

There are a total of 12 user stories (note these are numbered 1 to 13)

In relation to the epic for "create workspace for project we have two user stories"

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221416070-f6ec4570-20c0-46f4-a632-b27d2e6fe4ef.png)

Epic General Functionality Has Two User Stories

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221417143-dc1cca77-7dd8-4a90-8eba-83f36e4177bf.png)

Each of the above user stories have been labelled as a must have in order to have a fully functional project.  
Each user story has been labelled to indicate that it is a must have for the project. 

In order to implement the user stories it is hoped that it will be completed in 4 iteratioins assing 1 week to each iteration.

  Week 1 - Iteration 1

   Week 2 - Iteration 2

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106515976/221387708-822299fe-6ec4-4be1-80dc-9bd70fd84129.png)

  Week 4 - Iteration 4

  The above iterations are only an approximate.  As i am a student and very new to coding languages i found that when completing this project I would move onto other user stories without finishing the previous user story as i was conscious of time constraints and also trying research better ways and shorter code in getting functionality working.

  Epics / User Stories / Acceptance Criteria
  Github projects was used in the planning and setting up of this blog project. Here you will see a list of all epics, the user stories connected to these epics and  
  the acceptance criteria for each user story.  Each user story is catgorised into must haves, should have, could have. The Kanban board was used to draw up the individual tasks into different columns namely to do, in progress, done and and will not have..  As each task was worked on it moved from the to do column to the in progress column
    to the final column of done. 
      
  ## Structure - Database

  Structure of Blog Site 
  diagram of pages and blog site

  Header, footer and navigation bar consistent through all pages.
  links, buttons and forms provide feedback to the user of the site. 
  When a user signs up to the blog they have the opportunity to interact with the content by adding, deleting, updating their own posts and comments and  viewing, liking other posts and comments 

  Database Model 
  The database model is displayed on drawsql.  The type of database being used for this project is relational database which is managaed by PostgreSQL.

## Deployment 
This project was developed using a GitPod workspace. The code was commited to Git and pushed to GitHub using the terminal.

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1 Create the Heroku App:

2 Select "Create new app" in Heroku.

3 Choose a name for your app and select the location.

4 Attach the Postgres database:

5 In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku 
  Postgres option.

6 Prepare the environment and settings.py file:

6 In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to 
  DATABASE_URL.

7 In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.

8 Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py 
  file.

9 Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.

10 Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY 
   and DATABASE_URL file paths.

11 Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py 
   file also.

12 In settings.py add the following sections:
- Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
- STATICFILE_STORAGE
- STATICFILES_DIRS
- STATIC_ROOT
- MEDIA_URL
- DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
- TEMPLATES_DIR
- Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
- Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

13 Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:

14 Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and 
   templates.

15 reate a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
   web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

16 Go to Deploy tab on Heroku and connect to the GitHub, then to the required 
   recpository. 

17 Click on Delpoy Branch and wait for the build to load. When the build is 
   complete, the app can be opened through Heroku.

## Testing 

While completing this project i came across a number of errors and kept a record of same.  Now some of these errors maybe irrelavent due to changes in code or code deletion but below is just a sample of errors that I came across and how i resolved them.  

- When saving models file for the Post Model  got the following error:
  TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'max_lenght'
  content = RichTextField(max_lenght=5000, blank=True, null=True)
  max_length was spelled incorrect;y -  corrected same in post model  
- csiblog.Comment.contributor: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor for 'csiblog. 
  Comment.contributor' clashes with reverse accessor for 'csiblog.Post.contributor'.
  HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'csiblog.Comment.contributor' or 'csiblog.Post.contributor'.
  csiblog.Comment.contributor: (fields.E305) Reverse query name for 'csiblog.Comment.contributor' clashes with reverse query name for 'csiblog.Post.contributor'.
  HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'csiblog.Comment.contributor' or 'csiblog.Post.contributor'.
  csiblog.Post.contributor: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor for 'csiblog.Post.contributor' clashes with reverse accessor for 'csiblog.Comment.contributor'.
  HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'csiblog.Post.contributor' or 'csiblog.Comment.contributor'.
  csiblog.Post.contributor: (fields.E305) Reverse query name for 'csiblog.Post.contributor' clashes with reverse query name for 'csiblog.Comment.contributor'.
  HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'csiblog.Post.contributor' or 'csiblog.Comment.contributor'.
  models.ForeignKey(
  author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="csiblog_posts")
  got the error above when I tried to makemigrations on the comment model so changed my code to Post rather than user 
- Adding post update 
  Error -   File "/workspace/constructionblog/csiblog/urls.py", line 3, in <module>
  from .views import PostView, PostDetailView, PostAddView, PostUpdateView
  ImportError: cannot import name 'PostUpdateView' from 'csiblog.views' (/workspace/constructionblog/csiblog/views.py)
  File "/workspace/constructionblog/csiblog/urls.py", line 3, in <module>
  from .views import PostView, PostDetailView, PostAddView, PostUpdateView
  I mportError: cannot import name 'PostUpdateView' from 'csiblog.views' (/workspace/constructionblog/csiblog/views.py)
  In my views.py file 
  The code below was indented too far so corrected same and when I did it loaded update page

  class PostUpdate(UpdateView):
        model = Post
        fields = ('name', 'date', 'content',)
        success_url = reverse_lazy('postread.html')

- Add Delete Post functionality  - when adding same came across the following  error: 
TemplateSyntaxError at /delete/4
Unclosed tag on line 3: 'block'. Looking for one of: endblock.
To resolve the above error add {% endblock %} to postdelete.html template

- Update a post - received the following error - NoReverseMatch at /update/7
Reverse for 'postread' with keyword arguments '{'pk': 7}' not found. 1 pattern(s) tried: ['\\Z'] - In views.py  i had the following code to re-direct back to postread.html "success url = reverse_lazy('postread.html')" - i amended postread by deleting the html extension as follows "success url = reverse_lazy('postread)" - Once this was addded was able to update post.

- When deleting a post came across the following error: AttributeError at /csiblog/postdelete/15
'WSGIRequest' object has no attribute 'contributor' - in my views.py file line 61 in the test function changed code from "request self.request.contributor == self.get_object().user" to "return self.request.user == self.get_obejct().contributor.
